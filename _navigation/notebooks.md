Thanks for checking out my digital notebooks. They are specifically focused on cybersecurity certifications or niche topics. Please understand I am human and error prone. While parsing through this material, it's safe to say you will find spelling/gramatical errors. I might also be in the middle of adding or rewriting content so be kind if you have any feedback.
