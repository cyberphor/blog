## About
Hello world! My name is Victor Fernandez III and I have rewritten this bio half a dozen times. I serve in the US Army as a 255S Information Protection Technician. This means I am a Signal Warrant Officer and responsible for the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of cybersecurity solutions. When I'm lucky, I get to perform Enterprise (network/host) Security Monitoring (ESM) and Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR). 

I love learning, taking notes, and applying what I understand but I also love my family. We generally spend our time eating, daydreaming, and scaring ourselves with the paranormal. Please reach out via Twitter ([@cyberphor](https://twitter.com/cyberphor)) if you have any questions/input about this website or if you want to discuss a particular topic I covered.
