### The Blog
Victor started this blog because, despite having terrible handwriting, he wanted to share his notes from various IT and cybersecurity training events he has attended. He subscribes to the idea of being a “force multiplier,” or directly improving the skills of those around him in order to have a lasting impact on his community. His long term goals for the blog are to get it published as a book and accepted into the Library of Congress.
