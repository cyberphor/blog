This blog post explains how to install, configure, and use Snort. Snort is an intrusion prevention & detection system that acts upon a collection of rules whenever it "sniffs" a packet on your network. 

## Setup
1. Get Snort installed
2. Edit your main `.conf` file so it includes your ruleset & logging preferences
3. Add your rule
4. Verify your logging mechanisms are working
5. *Tail* your log
6. Test your rule
7. Start Snort with minimal parameters
8. Verify your rule was triggered (review your log)
9. Modify/add new rules as desired

### Requirements
For this tutorial, I am using two Virtual Machines (VMs):
* Kali Linux VM (w/Snort): `192.168.56.5`
* Debian Linux VM: `192.168.56.4`

### Installation
```
apt-get install snort
wget https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/06/28/2017-06-28-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap.zip
unzip 2017-06-28-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap.zip # password = infected
rm 2017-06-28-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap.zip
mv 2017-06-28-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap traffic.pcap
```

### Configuration
First, make a copy of your important files in the event you mess something up.
```bash
cp /etc/snort/snort.conf bak.snort.conf
cp /etc/snort/rules/local.rules bak.local.rules
```
**Specifying our ruleset & logging preferences**<br>
Find and open your main `.conf` file using a text-editor (I'm using `vim`). 
```bash
vim /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
My preference is to disable (comment-out) any original configuration settings I intend to change. I then add my changes beneath them (at least whenever I'm modifying a monolithic configuration file like this). For example, comment-out the lines that include `HOME_NET` and `dynamicdetection directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules`.
```bash
# ipvar HOME_NET any
<...snipped...>
# dynamicdetection directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules
```
Then, identify what your `HOME_NET` will be or rather, the network you want monitored. 
```bash
# ipvar HOME_NET any
ipvar HOME_NET [192.168.56.0/24]
```
Ensure the two lines below are enabled (remove any prefacing `#` symbols if they are disabled). The first line explicitly tells Snort to use our `local.rules` file when analyzing packets. The second line tells Snort how to communicate with our Syslog daemon. To our Syslog daemon, `LOG_AUTH` describes our logging facility, or source of events to log, while `LOG_ALERT` identifies the Severity Level of our logged events. [Request For Comments (RFC) document 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6) specifies `ALERT` as the second, most-high Severity Level for Syslog events.  
```bash
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT
```
Finally, as another option (this is not required to get Snort working), add an entry similiar to the one below. Here, we're telling Snort to also use its `log_tcpdump` module which will capture and log packets matching our specified ruleset in a `tcpdump` format.
```bash
# output log_tcpdump: tcpdump.log
output log_tcpdump: /var/log/snort/tcpdump.log
```

**Adding our first rule**<br>
Snort rules use the following syntax:
```bash
<action> <proto> <src> <src port> <dir> <dst> <dst port> <rule options>
```
In this tutorial, we're going to tell Snort to `alert` us whenever it sniffs `icmp` packets coming from `any` network & `any` port that's *destined* for our `$HOME_NET` (on `any` port). We also want Snort to log the message "ICMP traffic!" when this condition is met. Lastly, we're going to identify our rule as `sid:3000001`. If we want to update it later we can either re-write it, or add a *revision* number. 
```bash
vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rule
```
```bash
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP traffic!"; sid:3000001;)
```

### Testing
Before we do any kind of real testing, we need to make sure our logging mechanisms are working.
```bash
service --status-all | grep 'rsyslog'
```
```bash
[ + ]  rsyslog # good, our syslog daemon is working
```
Now, we'll start Snort, *tail* one of our log files, and then ping our Kali Linux VM to validate our ruleset. 

To make things a little easier to manage, I recommend opening two terminal sessions on your Kali VM: one for Snort, another to watch your log.  

**Starting Snort**<br>
To start Snort, specify the interface attached to your `HOME_NET` and the location of your configuration file. 
```bash
snort -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

**Tailing our log**<br>
In another terminal window on your Kali Linux VM, use `tail` and `grep` to watch Snort in action. 
```bash
tail -f /var/log/auth.log | grep snort
```

**Testing our ruleset**<br>
```bash
ping 192.168.56.5 # starting a ping on our Debian Linux VM
```

If everything was properly configured, you should see log entries similar to the one below. If you don't see anything like this, I recommend checking the log file you're *tailing*, your Syslog daemon, your network configuration, and/or your Snort configuration. 
```bash
<...snipped...>
Dec 20 07:49:12 kali snort: [1:3000001:0] ICMP traffic! {ICMP} 192.168.56.4 -> 192.168.56.5
<...snipped...>
```

You should also be able to read the `tcpdump` log Snort created if you enabled this module. For me, my log was identified as `tcpdump.log.1545225915`. This will be helpful later when we need to dig into what originally triggered Snort.  
```bash
tcpdump -r /var/log/snort/tcpdump.log.1545225915
```
```python
reading from file snort/tcpdump.log.1545225915, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
08:25:16.469579 IP 192.168.56.4 > kali: ICMP echo request, id 8498, seq 32, length 64
08:25:16.469611 IP kali > 192.168.56.4: ICMP echo reply, id 8498, seq 32, length 64

```

## PCAPs
```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -K none -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -r ../00_Setup/traffic.pcap
sudo snort -A cmg -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -r ../00_Setup/traffic.pcap
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -r ../00_Setup/traffic.pcap
```

## Alerts
```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -r ../00_Setup/traffic.pcap > alerts.log
```
