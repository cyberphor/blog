### Convert a PCAP to the SiLK format
```bash
# convert .pcap to .silk format
rwp2yaf2silk --in=evil.pcap --out=evil.silk
```

### Get total number of flow records
```bash
# [microscope] get total number of flow records ('read' field)
rwfilter evil.silk --proto=0-255 --print-stat
```

### Get unique hosts in a subnet
```bash
# [inventory] get unique hosts in a subnet and amount of bytes they sent
rwfilter evil.silk --scidr=192.168.56.0/24 --pass=stdout | rwuniq --fields=sIP --values=bytes
```

### Get source IPs of top 10 talkers (in bytes)
```bash
# [pyramid] get source IPs of top 10 talkers, in bytes
rwstats evil.silk --fields=sIP --bytes --count=10
```

### See who the "top talker" is sending traffic to
```bash
# see who 'top talker' is sending traffic to (can isolate convos w/tcpdump)
rwfilter evil.silk --saddress=192.168.56.101 --pass=stdout | rwcut -f 1-8
```

### Get flows that changed from SYN to SYN/ACK
```bash
# get flows that started w/SYN then, changed to at least SYN/ACK
rwfilter evil.silk --flags-initial S/SA --pass=stdout | rwcut --num-rec=5
```

### Get flows destined for port 53, and print top 10 src/dst IPs
```bash
# get flows destined for port 53; print top 10 src IPs & their dst IP
rwfilter evil.silk --dport=53 --pass=stdout | rwstats --fields=sIP,dPort --count=10
```

### Don't forgets
* SiLK: System for Internet-Level Knowledge
* One flow = half of a conversation
* `rwfilter`: use like a microscope
* `rwstats`: use to view "pyramids of data"
* `rwuniq`: use to get an inventory of data
* `--proto=0-` is shorthand for 0-255 (all protocols)
* `--scidr` is used for an entire subnet, `--sIP` is for a single IP address
* `rwuniq` doesn't support `-f` option, gets confused if you mean Fields or Flows
* `--num-rec=` can be used to limit number of flows printed to the console
