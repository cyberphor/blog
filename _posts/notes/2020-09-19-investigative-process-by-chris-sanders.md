### Overview
We use evidence to bridge the gap between perception and reality. The way we view evidence impacts how we answer specific questions about our reality (what happened). Transform data to answer questions more effectively. Pivoting between data sources is one of the best ways to answer questions during an analysis. 
```bash
Observations --> 
    (Questions <> Hypothesis <> Answers) --> 
        Decisions based on "Evidence" and "Conclusions"
```

### RECAP: Methods of Transforming Data
- Reduce: zoom in on specific data (shrink the timeline, exclude specific hosts)
- Expand: zoom out to all data (increase the timeline, include all hosts, etc.)
- Chart: visualize data (bars, lines, graphs, etc.)
- Aggregate: sort evidence by a unique data field
- Pivot: 
    - Pivoting enables you to...
        - Connect data sources
        - Move between low/high context data
        - Move between network/host data
        - Move between internal/external data
    - How to Pivot
        1. Search a data Source
        2. Select a *value of interest* from your search results
        3. Search another data source for current *value of interest*

### Evidence: Values of Interest and Pivoting Fields
- IP address (source/destination)
- IP/port
- Domain
- Username
- Filename
- Hash
- Process name

### Data Sources: Memory, Disk, and Network
- Alerts (Snort, Suricata, Squil)
- Netflow (Zeek logs, SiLK)
- Transactions (Zeek logs)
- Statistics (Elastic stack)
- PCAP (tcpdump, Wireshark, Tshark)
- OSINT (VirusTotal, CrowdStrike)
- Web proxy logs
- Windows log
- Registry keys
- File system

### Pivoting Examples
**Observation**  
An IDS alert for a suspicious file download.

**Question #1**  
Is this download legit or evil?
