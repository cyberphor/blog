I am serving my blog (this post) via the Jekyll Web App.

This past weekend I wrote three scripts: (#1) uploads local drafts to my remote web server, (#2) starts Jekyll if it is not already running and (#3) moves my drafts into the correct directory for publishing. I got two of the scripts to run by specifying one in my crontab with the other daisy-chained to it.

### Starting my lab
```bash
vim /scripts/startLab.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "[*] $(date +%H:%M:%S): Starting your draft machine."
screen -d -m vboxheadless -startvm DraftingMachine

until ping -c1 DraftingMachine > /dev/null
do 
	echo "[-] $(date +%H:%M:%S): Standby..."
done

echo "[+] $(date +%H:%M:%S): Your draft machine is ready."
ssh victor@DraftingMachine
```
```bash
chmod +x /scripts/startLab.sh
```
### Uploading drafts
```bash
vim /scripts/upload.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

blog='victor@WebServer:/home/victor/inbox/'
drafts=$(find /home/victor/jekyll/blog/_posts/*.md -mmin 1)

if [ -z "$drafts" ]
then 
	logger "[x] Nothing new to upload."
else 
	for file in $drafts
	do
		post=$(basename $file)
		logger "[+] Uploading $post"
		scp /home/victor/jekyll/blog/_posts/$post $blog
	done
fi
```
```bash
chmod +x /scripts/upload.sh
/scripts/upload.sh # execute as desired
```
### Keeping Jekyll alive
```bash
vim /scripts/hyde.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

if ! pgrep -x "jekyll" > /dev/null
then
	logger "[x] Jekyll is not running, starting it!"
	screen -d -m jekyll serve --watch -s /home/victor/jekyll/blog/
else
	logger "[+] Jekyll is running!"
	/scripts/publish.sh	# daisy-chains the script below
fi
```
```bash
chmod +x /scripts/hyde.sh
```
### Publishing blog posts

It took a while, but below is the script called upon if Jekyll is already running. The aim here is to move any Markdown files found in my `inbox` directory to the `_posts` directory. Obviously, this is a really specific use-case for such a small script, but hopefully it will inspire you to do something similar.

I’m not sure if I’ll keep this nuiance, but as in other posts, here’s the meat & potatoes you probably want.
```bash
vim /scripts/publish.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

if [ -e /home/victor/inbox/ ]
then
	for draft in /home/victor/inbox/*.md
	do
		post=$(basename $draft)
		if ! cmp -s $post /home/victor/jekyll/blog/_posts/$post
		then
			logger "[+] Publishing: $post"
			mv $draft /home/victor/jekyll/blog/_posts/
		else 
			logger "[-] Same edit: $post has already been published."
			rm $draft
		fi
	done
else
	logger "[+] Nothing to publish: inbox is empty."
fi
```
```bash
chmod +x /scripts/publish.sh
```
### Using cron to automate
As mentioned, your working environment may be different, but below is a copy of my crontab.
```bash
crontab -e
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * * /scripts/hyde.sh
```

Lastly, review/follow your Syslog file as necessary (for evidence your scripts are working).
```bash
tail -f /var/log/messages
```
If you run into any issues getting your crontab to work, there are a few things to check:
1. The `crond` daemon is running.
2. Your syntax.
3. Whether or not you left a new-line at the end of your crontab (sometimes required).
