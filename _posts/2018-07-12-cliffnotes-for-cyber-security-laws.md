## Hacking
**US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986** 
> Revises the definition of "financial institution" to which the financial record provisions of computer fraud law apply. Applies such provisions to any financial records (including those of corporations and small businesses), not just those of individuals and certain partnerships.

Modifies existing Federal law regarding accessing Federal computers. Makes the basic offense trespass. Removes criminal liability for exceeding (without the intent to defraud) authorized access to a Federal computer in one's own department or agency.

Creates new Federal criminal offenses of: (1) property theft by computer occurring as part of a scheme to defraud; (2) altering, damaging, or destroying information in, or preventing the authorized use of, a Federal interest computer; and (3) trafficking in computer access passwords...

Exempts authorized law enforcement or intelligence activities.

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 established a handful of computer-related activities as criminal offenses. These activities include (but are not limited to) the following: accessing a government computer without authorization, stealing financial/government information, damaging or causing the loss of a protected computer, and collecting passwords.

**US Children Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000**
> The protection measures must block or filter Internet access to pictures that are: (a) obscene; (b) child pornography; or (c) harmful to minors (for computers that are accessed by minors). Schools subject to CIPA have two additional certification requirements:<br>
1. their Internet safety policies must include monitoring the online activities of minors; and<br>
2. as required by the Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act, they must provide for educating minors about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, and cyberbullying awareness and response.

CIPA, among other things, established requirements for protecting the innocence of children (through an "Internet Safety Policy"). It mandates pornography and/or obscene material be filtered in schools & public libraries, prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of personal information relating to children, and forbids minors from gaining unauthorized access to information systems. CIPA is applicable to institutions recieving grants via the "E-Rate" (Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support) funding program.

## PII and PHI 
(Personally Identifiable Information & Protected Health Information)

**US Privacy Act of 1974**
> Prohibits disclosure by Federal agencies of any record contained in a system of records, except pursuant to a written request by or with the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. 

Requires agencies which keep records systems to keep account of disclosures of records, and to inform the subjects of such disclosures.

Requires relevancy of records to official purposes; accuracy; disclosure of purposes to informants; publication annually of the existence, character, and accessibility of records systems; and appropriate safeguards to maintain confidentiality of such records...

Permits civil suits against agencies by individuals adversely affected by agency actions not in compliance with this Act. Describes remedies available in such actions.

Sets forth criminal penalties for noncompliance with this Act.

Provides for exemptions from this Act, such as for specified records of the Central Intelligence Agency and records of investigations compiled for law enforcement purposes.

Prohibits an agency from selling or renting an individual's name and address.

The infamous Privacy Act of 1974 requires federal agencies to protect the information and records of "individuals involved" from unauthorized disclosure. Law enforcement and the CIA are exempted.

## Net neutrality
Net neutrality is when Internet Service Providers “treat all online content equally without blocking or slowing down specific websites on purpose or allowing companies to pay for preferential treatment” (The Guardian). 

**Communications Act of 1934, Title II, Section 202**  
>  It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage

In 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to remove the “common carrier” classification from Internet and Cellular Service Providers.

## Information Security Programs
**US Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002**
> text goes here

FISMA of 2002 (requires InfoSec for federal information systems; use NIST SPs for compliance and governance.)
The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 establishes information security requirements for systems used by the federal government. It was introduced under the E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107-37, as Title III. It establishes a framework for protecting the infrastructure, operation, and data of the federal government. It also mandates the coordination between civilian, national security, and law enforcement agencies. Lastly, it emphasizes on the importance of risk management in protecting federal information systems. In order to facilitate guidelines for FISMA-compliance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created Special Publications (SP) such as NIST SP 800-18, NIST SP 800-30, NIST SP 800-37, NIST SP 800-53 as well as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199 and FIPS Publication.

**US Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995**
> text goes here

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 introduced the concept of "Information Resource Management (IRM)." IRM is essentially the art of managing resources to efficiently and effectively accomplish the mission of the Department of Defense (DoD). For example, the DoD should strive to require as little paperwork as possible when interacting with the public. In other words, the act requires the reduction of "red tape."
