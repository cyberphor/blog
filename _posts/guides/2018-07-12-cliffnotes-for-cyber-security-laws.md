**US Children Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000**
> The protection measures must block or filter Internet access to pictures that are: (a) obscene; (b) child pornography; or (c) harmful to minors (for computers that are accessed by minors). Schools subject to CIPA have two additional certification requirements:<br>
1. their Internet safety policies must include monitoring the online activities of minors; and<br>
2. as required by the Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act, they must provide for educating minors about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, and cyberbullying awareness and response.

CIPA, among other things, established requirements for protecting the innocence of children (through an "Internet Safety Policy"). It mandates pornography and/or obscene material be filtered in schools & public libraries, prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of personal information relating to children, and forbids minors from gaining unauthorized access to information systems. CIPA is applicable to institutions recieving grants via the "E-Rate" (Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support) funding program.

FISMA of 2002 (requires InfoSec for federal information systems; use NIST SPs for compliance and governance.)
The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 establishes information security requirements for systems used by the federal government. It was introduced under the E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107-37, as Title III. It establishes a framework for protecting the infrastructure, operation, and data of the federal government. It also mandates the coordination between civilian, national security, and law enforcement agencies. Lastly, it emphasizes on the importance of risk management in protecting federal information systems. In order to facilitate guidelines for FISMA-compliance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created Special Publications (SP) such as NIST SP 800-18, NIST SP 800-30, NIST SP 800-37, NIST SP 800-53 as well as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199 and FIPS Publication.
