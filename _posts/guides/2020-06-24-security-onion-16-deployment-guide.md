## Overview
### Security Onion Requirements
* CPU: 4 cores 
* Memory: 8 GBs
* Disk space: 500 GBs (a Solid State Drive is preferred)
* Network Interface Cards: 2 (one for remote management, one to sniff locally)
* Routing between the “Master” and “Heavy Nodes”
* Firewall ports: when the "Master" is the destination
    * SSH (TCP port 22): nodes share their Elasticsearch databases here
    * Kibana (TCP port 443): analysts view all logs here
    * Salt dispatch (TCP port 4505): the "Master" publishes orchestration commands from here
    * Salt reporting (TCP port 4506): nodes send orchestration results here
    * Squil front-end (TCP port 7734): analysts manage Snort/Suricata alerts here
    * Squil back-end (TCP port 7736): nodes send Snort/Suricata alerts here
* Firewall ports: when your "Heavy Nodes" are the destination
    * SSH (TCP port 22): node Elasticsearch databases are accessed here
    * Syslog (TCP 514): Syslog events (ex: from routers, web servers, etc.) are sent here
    * Winlogbeat (TCP port 5044): Microsoft Windows events are sent here

### Steps for deploying a distributed grid of intrusion sensors

        * Enable remote access to Analyst applications
        * Create additional Analyst accounts 
    * Deploy your “Heavy Nodes”
        * Allow Microsoft Windows events to be ingested
        * Allow Syslog events to be ingested 
4. Establish host-based monitoring
    * Enable “Microsoft Windows Remote Management (WinRM)” 
    * Enable “Microsoft Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)” 
    * Deploy “Event Collectors” 
    * Deploy “Sysmon" from Microsoft Windows SysInternals
    * Deploy “Winlogbeat" by Elastic
    * Enable "Syslog Forwarding"
